# 📁 Project Showcase – Mary Meenu Antony

Welcome! This repository highlights selected academic and personal projects that combine my interest in **software testing**, **automation**, **robotics** 🤖🧪💡

Here, you’ll find **videos, project reports, and visual demos** — not code, but clear outcomes of the systems I helped build and test.
